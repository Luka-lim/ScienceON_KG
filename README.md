# ScienceON Knowledge Graph System: Exploring New Frontiers in Science and Technology Information Integration System

Welcome to the official repository for the ScienceON Knowledge Graph System, a comprehensive framework developed to enhance the integration and analysis of science and technology information. This project represents a significant advancement in knowledge graph technology, aiming to provide deep insights and a robust understanding of complex relationships in the scientific and technological domains.

## Introduction
The ScienceON Knowledge Graph System is designed to address the challenges associated with the vast amounts of data generated in the fields of science and technology. By creating a structured and interconnected environment, this system facilitates more sophisticated data analysis, enhances search capabilities, and supports innovative research methodologies.

This knowledge graph integrates various types of data, including:
+ Scientific papers
+ Patents
+ Research reports
+ R&D projects

## Features
+ Data Ecosystem Development: Aggregates and integrates diverse scientific and technological data using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
+ Knowledge Graph Construction: Utilizes the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to create a detailed and interconnected representation of scientific activities.
+ User-Centric Applications: Leverages the knowledge graph for graph-related experiments and the development of applications tailored to the needs of researchers and practitioners.

## Experiencing ScienceON
Our services are accessible via the ScienceON platform [ScienceON](https://scienceon.kisti.re.kr/). All data can be accessed through the ScienceON API Gateway at [ScienceON API Gateway](https://scienceon.kisti.re.kr/apigateway).

## Contributions
This repository is a part of our efforts to democratize access to complex data and provide the community with tools to explore and analyze the intricate web of science and technology data. We encourage contributions from the community to help us improve and expand the capabilities of the ScienceON Knowledge Graph System.
